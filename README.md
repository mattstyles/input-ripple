# input-ripple

Moved to [urban-input](https://github.com/mattstyles/urban-input)

```
bower install --save urban-input
```

Messed up migration so I'm pretty sure old versions wont work, but they
all exist over at
[urban-input](https://github.com/mattstyles/urban-input), as well as new
shinier versions.
